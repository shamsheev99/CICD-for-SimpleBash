RATIONAL
historical versions of the  utility include the options -e, -t, and -v,
 wich permit the ends of lines, <tab>s, and invisible characters, respectively, to be rendered visible in the output. The standard developers omitted these options because they provide too fine a degree of control over what is made visible, and similar output can be obtained using a command such as:


sed -n -e 's/$/$/' -e l pathname

The -s option was omitted because it corresponds to different functions in BSD and System V-based systems. The BSD -s option to squeeze blank lines can be accomplished by the shell script shown in the following example:


sed -n '
# Write non-empty lines.
/./   {
      p
      d
      }
# Write a single empty line, then look for more empty lines.
/^$/  p
# Get next line, discard the held <newline> (empty line),
# and look for more empty lines.
:Empty
/^$/  {
      N
      s/.//
      b Empty
      }
# Write the non-empty line before going back to search
# for the first in a set of empty lines.
      p

The System V -s option to silence error messages can be accomplished by redirecting the standard error. Note that the BSD documentation for cat uses the term "blank line" to mean the same as the POSIX "empty line'': a line consisting only of a <newline>.

The BSD -n option was omitted because similar functionality can be obtained from the -n option of the pr utility.
